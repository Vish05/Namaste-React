**Hooks -**

    - Hook is normal javascript function
    - React Developer given different hooks

**useState -**

    - useState is used to create local state variable

**Microservice -**

    A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.
    For eg: - UI can be in React, BackEnd in Java, notfications in Python,Logs in Paython and Authentication via GoLang

    Features of Microservices:
        - Seperation of concerns,
        - Separate deployment as every work and task is different and independent.
        - Single responsibility.

**Monolith architecture -**

    Monolithic is an architecture where services are tightly coupled with each other and run as a single service and hence difficult to scaled when more changes comes in pictures.

    So basically, to change one button in UI we have to deploy whole project and build the whole application for each and every small change. Mostly old applications still follows Monolith architecture.

**Shimmer UI -**

    A shimmer UI resembles the page's actual empty boxes structured UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up. It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (it's currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 300-500ms to load.

**CORS -**

    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
